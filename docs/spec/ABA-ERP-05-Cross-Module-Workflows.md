# ABA Online ERP — Document 5: Cross-Module Workflows, Event Map & Implementation Guidance

**Purpose:** Ties Docs 1–4 together. Defines the end-to-end workflows, the **domain event map** that connects modules, the **status-transition rules** each module must enforce, the UI touchpoints (links, badges, toasts, invalidations) that make ABA one interconnected system, and the recommended build order for the existing Next.js app.
**Reading guide:** Each workflow has (a) a flow, (b) step table: *actor → screen → action → system effects → modules touched*, (c) exceptions, (d) UI/frontend requirements, (e) mock-mode behaviour.

---

## 1. Domain Event Map (the backbone)

Modules do not call each other's internals. They emit **domain events**; other modules subscribe. In **live mode** the backend handles this; in **mock mode** the mock store (Doc 1 §16.3) simulates the same effects so the UI behaves identically. The frontend's job is to (1) trigger the right action, (2) invalidate the right queries, (3) show the effects via links/timelines.

| Event | Emitted by | Consumed by (effects) |
|---|---|---|
| `order.placed` | Orders/POS | Inventory (reserve), Customers (last order), Audit |
| `order.approved` | Orders | Orders (→ pending), Notifications |
| `payment.completed` | Payments | Orders (paid status), Customers (wallet/balance), Finance (JE), Commissions (qualification check), Notifications |
| `order.fulfilled` | Orders | Inventory (issue), Finance (COGS), Commissions (if trigger = delivered) |
| `order.completed` | Orders | Finance (revenue/AR), Referrals (qualify), Commissions (engine), Reports cache |
| `order.cancelled` | Orders | Inventory (release), Payments (refund request), Commissions (cancel pending) |
| `return.approved` | Orders/POS | Inventory (restock/quarantine), Payments (refund), Finance, Commissions (reversal) |
| `refund.completed` | Payments | Orders (status), Finance (reversal), Commissions (proportional reversal), Customers (wallet if chosen) |
| `pr.approved` | Procurement | Procurement (ready to convert), Notifications |
| `po.issued` | Procurement | Suppliers (open PO), Notifications, Finance (commitment—informational only) |
| `grn.posted` | Procurement | Inventory (receipt movement + valuation), Finance (Dr Inventory/Cr GRNI), PO progress |
| `supplier_invoice.approved` | Procurement | Finance (AP), Suppliers (balance) |
| `supplier_payment.completed` | Payments | Finance (AP cleared), Suppliers (balance), Procurement (invoice paid) |
| `stock.low` | Inventory | Procurement (suggested PR), Notifications, Sidebar badge |
| `transfer.shipped / received` | Inventory | Inventory (in-transit/destination), Finance (inter-location value; no P&L effect), Merchants (stock) |
| `adjustment.posted` | Inventory | Finance (shrinkage/gain) |
| `wo.released` | Production | Inventory (reserve materials) |
| `wo.materials_issued` | Production | Inventory (consume), Finance (Dr WIP/Cr Raw) |
| `wo.output_recorded` | Production | Inventory (finished goods +), Finance (Dr FG/Cr WIP) |
| `wo.closed` | Production | Finance (variances), Reports (cost) |
| `referral.qualified` | Referrals | Commissions (engine), Notifications |
| `commission.created / approved / reversed` | Commissions | Customers (balances), Finance (expense/payable), Notifications, Payouts (available) |
| `payout.requested` | Payouts | Commissions/Wallet (hold), Notifications |
| `payout.paid / failed` | Payouts | Payments (outgoing record), Finance (Dr payable/Cr bank), Commissions (paid), Notifications |
| `pos.session_closed` | POS | Finance (cash handover, over/short), Reports |
| `period.closed` | Finance | All posting modules (block backdated), Reports |
| `*` (every mutation) | All | **Audit** (immutable entry) |

**Frontend invalidation map** (single file `lib/invalidation.ts`; extends Doc 1 §16.4):
```text
completeOrder      → orders.*, inventory.stock, inventory.movements, payments.*, finance.overview,
                     commissions.*, referrals.*, customers.detail, dashboard.*, nav.counts
recordPayment      → payments.*, orders.detail, customers.detail(wallet), finance.*, commissions.pending
receiveGoods       → procurement.po.detail, procurement.grn.*, inventory.*, finance.payables, nav.counts
approveCommission  → commissions.*, customers.commissions, payouts.available, finance.overview, nav.counts
processPayout      → payouts.*, payments.*, commissions.paid, finance.*, nav.counts
postProductionOutput → production.wo.detail, inventory.*, finance.*, dashboard.production
closeSession       → pos.*, finance.transactions, reports.pos
```

---

## 2. Status Lifecycles & Allowed Transitions (single source of truth)

UI rule: action buttons render **only for allowed transitions** for the user's permissions (hidden if no permission, disabled with tooltip if state prevents). All terminal states are read-only.

| Entity | Transitions |
|---|---|
| **Order** | Draft → (Awaiting Approval) → Pending → Processing → Ready → Out for Delivery → Completed · Any pre-Completed → Cancelled · Completed → Partially Refunded → Refunded |
| **Payment (order)** | Unpaid → Partially Paid → Paid · Paid → Partially Refunded → Refunded · Unpaid/Partially → Overdue (computed) · Failed → (retry) Pending |
| **Payment record** | Pending/Processing → Completed \| Failed \| Cancelled · Completed → Partially Refunded \| Refunded \| Voided (same-day) |
| **PR** | Draft → Awaiting Approval → Approved \| Rejected \| (Changes requested → Draft) · Approved → Converted · Any → Cancelled |
| **PO** | Draft → Awaiting Approval → Approved → Ordered → Partially Received → Received → Closed · Ordered/Approved → Cancelled (if nothing received) |
| **Supplier invoice** | Draft → Matched \| On Hold → Approved → Partially Paid → Paid · On Hold → Approved (variance override) \| Void |
| **Transfer** | Draft → Awaiting Approval → Approved → In Transit → Partially Received → Completed · Pre-shipment → Cancelled |
| **Adjustment / Count** | Draft → Awaiting Approval → Posted \| Rejected · Count: Draft → Counting → Under Review → Posted |
| **BOM** | Draft → Active → Archived |
| **Production order** | Draft → Planned → Released → In Progress ⇄ Paused → Completed → Closed · Pre-completion → Cancelled |
| **Referral** | Registered → Ordered → Pending Qualification → Qualified \| Expired · Any → Flagged → Qualified \| Disqualified |
| **Commission** | Pending → Approved → Paid · Pending/Approved → Rejected \| Reversed \| On Hold · Paid → (clawback record) Reversed |
| **Payout** | Pending → Approved → Processing → Paid \| Failed → (retry) Processing \| Rejected · Pending/Approved → Cancelled · Any → On Hold |
| **Refund** | Requested → Approved → Processing → Completed \| Rejected \| Failed |
| **Journal** | Draft → Awaiting Approval → Posted → Reversed (by new entry) |
| **Period** | Open → Closing → Closed → Locked · Closed → Open (reopen, privileged) |
| **POS session** | Open → Closing → Closed \| Force-closed |
| **Merchant / User / Supplier** | Pending/Invited → Active ⇄ Suspended/On hold → Inactive/Deactivated |

---

## 3. Workflow 1 — Sales (Admin/Storefront order → completion)

```text
Customer → Product → Sales Order → (Approval) → Payment → Inventory → Fulfilment → Finance → Reporting
```

| # | Actor | Screen | Action | System effects | Modules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sales officer | `/orders/new` | Select customer, merchant, add items | Live stock check per line, price list applied, credit/wallet shown | Customers, Products, Inventory |
| 2 | Sales officer | Order form | **Place order** | Order `Pending` (or `Awaiting Approval` if discount/credit beyond limit); stock **reserved**; `order.placed`. **WhatsApp alert** sent to Merchant/Vendor for instant fulfillment prep | Orders, Inventory, Audit |
| 2a | Approver | Approval drawer / Action Center | Approve/Reject | Approve → `Pending`; reject → `Cancelled` w/ reason; requester notified | Orders, Notifications |
| 3 | Cashier/Finance | Order detail → Record payment | Enter payment | `payment.completed`; order Paid/Partially Paid; JE Dr Cash/Cr AR; receipt. **WhatsApp update** to Customer ("Payment confirmed") | Payments, Orders, Finance, Customers |
| 4 | Warehouse | Order detail → Fulfil | Pack/ship/deliver (partial allowed) | `order.fulfilled`; stock **issued** (reservation → movement); JE Dr COGS/Cr Inventory. **WhatsApp update** to Customer ("Order Shipped/Delivered") | Inventory, Finance |
| 5 | System | — | Order fully paid + delivered ⇒ `Completed` | `order.completed`; revenue recognised (Dr AR/Cash…Cr Sales/VAT); referral qualification check; commission engine | Finance, Referrals, Commissions |
| 6 | Manager | `/sales`, `/reports` | Review | Dashboards/reports refresh via invalidation | Reports |

**Exceptions:** insufficient stock (block or backorder), price changed between load and place (banner + refresh), payment failure (retry/other method, order stays `Pending`), cancel after payment (auto **refund request**), partial delivery (order stays `Processing`), credit sale over limit (approval), period closed for chosen date (error on backdated payment).
**UI requirements:** order detail's **Overview** shows a "Related records" panel linking payment(s), stock movements, invoice, journal entry, referral & commissions; StepIndicator reflects status; every toast names the record ("Order ORD-10482 placed").
**Mock mode:** placing an order decrements *available* (not on-hand); fulfil decrements on-hand; payment creates a JE in the mock ledger; completion creates commission records if the customer has an upline.

---

## 4. Workflow 2 — Merchant POS Sale

```text
POS Session → Product Selection → Cart → Customer → Payment → Receipt → Inventory → Sales → Finance → Commission
```

| # | Actor | Screen | Action | Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cashier | `/pos/session/open` | Enter opening cash | Session `Open`; float recorded |
| 2 | Cashier | `/pos/sell` | Scan/tap products | Cart lines; stock chips update live |
| 3 | Cashier | Cart | Select customer (or walk-in), optional referral code, discounts | Discount over limit → manager PIN |
| 4 | Cashier | Payment sheet | Cash / Transfer / Card / Wallet / Split | Tender rows sum to total |
| 5 | System | — | **Complete sale** (idempotent) | Order created `Completed` (channel POS) → payments recorded → stock **issued** at merchant location → JE (sales, COGS, cash/clearing) → referral/commission triggers |
| 6 | Cashier | Success screen | Print/SMS/email receipt, New sale | Receipt saved; audit |
| 7 | Cashier/Manager | `/pos/session/close` | Count cash → reconcile → close | Expected vs counted; `pos.session_closed` → Finance cash handover & over/short JE; session report |

**Exceptions:** offline (cash/hold only; queue with idempotency keys; conflicts on sync surfaced to manager), transfer never arrives (timeout → keep waiting/change method), card failure (order not created; cart preserved), returns (see §12), stale session >24h (manager forced close), closing with held orders (must resolve).
**UI requirements:** POS uses separate shell; toasts ≤2s, non-blocking; the "≤4 taps" happy path must be preserved by any change. POS orders appear in ERP Orders with channel chip "POS" and link to session.

---

## 5. Workflow 3 — Procurement (Request → Payment)

```text
Purchase Request → Approval → Purchase Order → Supplier → Goods Received → Inventory Updated → Supplier Invoice → Payment → Finance
```

| # | Actor | Screen | Action | Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Requester / system | `/procurement/requests/new` (or "Create request" from low-stock / shortage) | Submit PR | PR `Awaiting Approval`; approver notified |
| 2 | Approver | PR detail / Action Center | Approve / Reject / Request changes | `pr.approved` |
| 3 | Procurement | PR list → Convert | Group by supplier → create PO(s) | PR → `Converted`; PO `Draft` prefilled |
| 4 | Procurement / Finance | PO detail | Submit → (threshold approval) → **Issue PO** | PO `Ordered`; PDF/email to supplier; supplier's open PO list |
| 5 | Warehouse | `/procurement/receiving/new?po=` | Post GRN (full or partial; accept/reject qty) | `grn.posted`: **Inventory + accepted qty**, valuation updated, JE Dr Inventory/Cr GRNI; PO `Partially Received`/`Received`; rejects → Quarantine |
| 6 | Accountant | `/procurement/invoices/new` | Enter supplier invoice; 3-way match | Match OK → `Approved`, JE Dr GRNI/Cr AP; mismatch → `On Hold` until resolved |
| 7 | Finance | Payables → Pay selected | Supplier payment | `supplier_payment.completed`: JE Dr AP/Cr Bank; invoice `Paid`; supplier balance ↓ |
| 8 | System | — | Supplier performance metrics recalculated (on-time, fill rate, price variance) | Suppliers, Reports |

**Exceptions:** over-receipt beyond tolerance (blocked), short delivery (PO stays open or **Close short**), invoice price variance (hold + approval), supplier credit note/return (Purchase Return → stock out → debit note), PO amended after issue (revision + re-approval if total ↑>5%), supplier over credit limit (warning), cancelled PO after partial receipt (blocked → close short).
**UI requirements:** PO detail shows StepIndicator through *Paid*; every stage links to the next document (PO → GRN → Invoice → Payment); Action Center aggregates pending approvals; low-stock table has bulk "Create request".

---

## 6. Workflow 4 — Inventory (Stock change map)

```text
Receipts (+) · Production output (+) · Returns (+) · Transfers in (+)  →  STOCK  →  Sales/POS issue (−) · Production consumption (−) · Transfers out (−) · Adjustments (±) · Purchase returns (−)
```

| Trigger | Movement | Location effect | Finance effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| GRN posted | Receipt | + warehouse | Dr Inventory / Cr GRNI |
| Order placed / WO released | Reservation | Available ↓ (on-hand unchanged) | none |
| Order fulfilled / POS complete | Sales issue | − source | Dr COGS / Cr Inventory |
| Sales return (resellable) | Sales return | + (or Quarantine if damaged) | Dr Inventory / Cr COGS (+ revenue reversal) |
| Materials issued to WO | Production consumption | − raw | Dr WIP / Cr Raw |
| Output recorded | Production output | + finished | Dr FG / Cr WIP |
| Transfer shipped/received | Transfer out/in | − source → transit → + destination | none (or inter-branch clearing) |
| Adjustment/count posted | Adjustment ± | ± | Dr/Cr Shrinkage vs Inventory |
| Write-off | Write-off | − | Dr Write-off expense |

**Alerts loop:** `stock.low` → sidebar badge + notification → dashboard low-stock table → **Create request** → PR (Workflow 3) → GRN → stock restored → alert clears.
**UI requirements:** every quantity number on Stock Levels opens the movement drawer; movement rows link back to their source document; no screen ever edits a balance directly.

---

## 7. Workflow 5 — Production

```text
Production Request → BOM → Raw Materials Check → Production Order → Material Consumption → Stages → Finished Goods → Inventory → Sales
```

| # | Actor | Screen | Action | Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Production mgr | `/production/orders/new` | Choose product (active BOM), qty, dates | Requirement panel computes materials incl. wastage; shortage flags |
| 2 | Production mgr | Same | Shortage → **Create purchase request** | Workflow 3 starts; WO stays `Planned` |
| 3 | Production mgr | WO detail | **Release** | Materials **reserved**; `wo.released` |
| 4 | Storekeeper | WO → Materials → Issue | Issue to floor | `Production consumption` movements; JE Dr WIP/Cr Raw |
| 5 | Operators/Supervisor | WIP board / WO → Stages | Start/complete stages with good/rejected qty | Stage progress; scrap recorded with reason |
| 6 | Supervisor | WO → Output | **Record output** (partial allowed) | Finished goods **+** at output location; JE Dr FG/Cr WIP; unit cost computed |
| 7 | Production mgr | WO → Close | Review variance (price/usage/yield) | `wo.closed`: variance JE; report data final |
| 8 | Sales | Orders/POS | Finished goods now sellable | Workflow 1/2 |

**Exceptions:** material shortage mid-run (Pause with reason; request more), over-consumption (variance flagged; approval above tolerance), rejects beyond threshold (alert), BOM change mid-order (WO keeps its version), cancel after consumption (WIP loss requires approval), partial output before completion.
**UI requirements:** BOM shows resulting standard cost and margin; WO header shows progress and cost per unit vs standard; shortage rows always carry an action button to procurement.

---

## 8. Workflow 6 — Referral → Commission → Payout → Finance

```text
Customer → Referral (code/link) → Referred Customer → Order → Qualified Referral → Commission (pending) → Approval → Available → Payout Request → Approval → Payout → Finance → Reporting
```

| # | Actor | Screen | Action | Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Referrer | `/account/referrals/share` | Copies link/code | Clicks tracked |
| 2 | Prospect | Storefront/POS | Signs up or enters code | Referral `Registered`; upline set (first attribution wins; self/circular blocked) |
| 3 | Referred customer | Orders/POS | Places and pays first qualifying order | Referral `Ordered` → `Pending Qualification` |
| 4 | System | — | Trigger met (per plan: paid / delivered / min spend) | `referral.qualified` → Referral `Qualified` |
| 5 | System | — | Commission engine resolves rule (product > campaign > merchant > plan) and creates records per upline level (with caps) | Commissions `Pending` (holding period); referrer notified |
| 6 | System / Finance | Commissions approvals queue | Holding period ends, no return/fraud flag → auto/manual **Approve** | `Approved`; beneficiary *Available* balance ↑; JE Dr Commission expense/Cr Commissions payable |
| 7 | Beneficiary | `/account/wallet/withdraw` | Payout request | Amount **held**; `Pending` |
| 8 | Finance | Payouts | Risk checks → Approve → Process (bank/manual/batch) | `Processing` → `Paid`/`Failed` |
| 9 | System | — | `payout.paid` | Payment (out) record; JE Dr Commissions payable/Cr Bank; commissions → `Paid`; receipt to payee |
| 10 | Manager | Reports | Referral & commission reports | Reconciles: Commissions payable = unpaid approved commissions |

**Exceptions:** refund/return before/after approval (Workflow 12), fraud flag (commissions `On Hold` → cleared/disqualified), payout failure (release hold, retry ≤3), payee bank name mismatch (flag), upline reassignment (recalculates pending only), plan changed mid-way (old records keep their plan version).
**Open client decisions (config, not code):** number of levels, rates per level, qualification trigger, holding period, payout method/minimum. UI must not embed any of these values.

---

## 9. Workflow 7 — Payment (Money in / out)

```text
Document (Order/Invoice/Top-up/Supplier invoice) → Payment initiated → Confirmation (instant / gateway / manual) → Allocation → Finance posting → Receipt → Reconciliation
```
- **In:** Order/wallet payments (Cash, Transfer, Card, Wallet, Cheque). Instant methods complete immediately; Transfer/Cheque remain `Pending` until confirmed (manual by Finance or matched at reconciliation); Card/Gateway resolve by webhook.
- **Out:** Supplier payments, refunds, payouts, expenses — all create Payment records with direction *Out*.
- **Allocation:** one payment can settle multiple documents; excess becomes wallet credit (customers) or prepayment (suppliers) after explicit confirmation.
- **Reconciliation:** monthly per bank/gateway account (Doc 3 §4.11); unmatched items create suspense entries requiring resolution before period close.
**Exceptions:** duplicate reference (warning), gateway timeout ("Check status"), payment into a closed period (blocked/queued), chargeback (manual reversal journal + flagged).

---

## 10. Workflow 8 — Finance Posting & Period Close (Month-end)

```text
Operational events → Auto journals → Ledger → Subledger checks → Reconciliations → Period checklist → Close → Statements → Reports
```
| Step | Owner | Screen | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | All modules | — | Events post automatically; failures listed in *Unposted events* |
| 2 | POS managers | `/pos` | All sessions closed |
| 3 | Finance | Payments → Reconciliation | Bank/gateway accounts reconciled (warning if not) |
| 4 | Inventory | Inventory → Valuation / Counts | Valuation = GL (difference 0) |
| 5 | Procurement/Finance | Procurement | GRNs without invoice reviewed (GRNI clearing) |
| 6 | Finance | Finance → Reconciliation hub | AR, AP, Wallet liability, Commissions payable subledgers = GL |
| 7 | Accountant | Journals | Accruals/adjustments posted and approved |
| 8 | Finance Manager | Periods → Close | Blockers = 0; typed confirmation → `Closed` |
| 9 | Finance/Owner | Reports | P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow generated; drill to source |
**Exceptions:** late backdated event (queued into next open period with flag), reopen (privileged, audited, next period must be open), lock at year end.

---

## 11. Workflow 9 — Stock Transfer to Merchant & Merchant Settlement

**Restock:** Merchant manager → Transfer request (`/inventory/transfers/new`) → Warehouse approves → Ships (in transit) → Merchant receives (per-line, discrepancies recorded) → Merchant stock ↑ → merchant can sell via POS.
**Settlement (for merchants who collect on ABA's behalf or earn margins):** POS/orders accumulate merchant balance → Merchant requests settlement (or schedule) → Finance reviews (collections vs commissions vs stock invoices) → Payout (type *Merchant settlement*) → Payment out → JE Dr Merchant settlement payable/Cr Bank → statement to merchant.
**Exceptions:** stock discrepancy on receipt (adjustment + flag), negative settlement (merchant owes ABA → receivable), suspended merchant (block new POS sales; open sessions must be closed first).

---

## 12. Workflow 10 — Returns, Refunds & Commission Reversal

```text
Return request → Approval → Inventory (restock/quarantine) → Refund (approval) → Payment out → Finance reversal → Commission reversal → Reports
```
| Step | Effect |
|---|---|
| Return created (order or POS) | Lines/qty validated against sold − already returned; reason + condition captured |
| Return approved | Restock (resellable) or Quarantine/write-off (damaged); Dr Inventory/Cr COGS or Dr Write-off |
| Refund requested → approved (limit-based) | Method: original / wallet / cash / transfer |
| Refund completed | Payment out; JE Dr Sales returns/Cr Cash|Bank|Wallet; order → Partially Refunded / Refunded |
| Commission reversal | For each commission from that order: **Pending → cancelled**, **Approved-unpaid → reversed**, **Paid → clawback** against future earnings. Amounts proportional to refunded value. Beneficiaries notified; Finance sees clawback list |
| Referral effect | If the qualifying order is fully refunded before holding period end, referral returns to `Pending Qualification` (setting) |
**UI:** refund drawer shows a **"Downstream impact" preview** (stock restocked, journal entries, commissions affected with amounts) before confirmation; order Timeline records each step.

---

## 13. Workflow 11 — Customer Wallet

Top-up (Payment in → Dr Cash/Cr Wallet liability) → Spend at order/POS (Wallet tender → Dr Wallet liability/Cr AR/Revenue) → Commission payout to wallet (option: Dr Commissions payable/Cr Wallet liability) → Withdrawal (Payout: Dr Wallet liability/Cr Bank) → Refund to wallet. Ledger is append-only; balance = Σ entries; adjustments require reason + approval. Reconciliation hub compares Σ wallets to GL liability.

---

## 14. Workflow 12 — Exception & Approval Handling (patterns applied everywhere)

1. **Approval requests** appear in: the record's ApprovalPanel, the approver's Action Center, sidebar badge, notification (in-app + email). Approving from the Action Center uses the same drawer as the record page.
2. **Escalation:** unapproved beyond SLA (setting; default 48h) → reminder → escalates to next approver role.
3. **Rejection** always requires a reason; requester can edit and resubmit (new approval cycle, history retained).
4. **Concurrency:** 409 Conflict → "This record was updated by {user}" Alert with Reload; long forms save drafts.
5. **Failures in downstream effects** (e.g., commission engine error, posting failure) never roll back the business action; they raise a flag on the record + admin alert and are retryable from a queue (*Unposted events*, *Commission errors*).
6. **Idempotency:** all payment, payout, order, and sync-from-offline submissions carry idempotency keys; duplicates return the original result.

---

## 15. Cross-Module UI Touchpoints (checklist)

| Where | Must show / link to |

| Every record | Activity tab (audit), Timeline, Documents, `EntityLink` hover cards |

---

## 16. Screen Inventory (page-level index)

## 17. Implementation Guidance for the Existing Next.js App

**Principles:** don't break working screens; migrate module by module; keep URLs (add redirects); ≤250 lines per file; maximum reuse via `components/ui`, `components/patterns`, `features/<module>`; mock-first with real API signatures (Doc 1 §16).

### 17.1 Audit step (do first, ~1 day)
Produce a table for `apps/web`: route → file → module → completeness (Complete / Partial / Stub / Template-only) → components used → data source (hardcoded / mock service / API). Use it to fill Doc 1 §17 and classify every item as **Retain / Modify / Complete / New**. Flag: duplicated components, inline styles/Bootstrap leftovers, hardcoded data inside components, inconsistent status colors, pages exceeding 250 lines.

### 17.2 Phased build order (dependency-driven)
| Phase | Scope | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **0 Foundation** | Tokens, primitives, AppShell/sidebar/header, DataTable, FilterBar, forms kit, StatusBadge/statusMap, Timeline, ApprovalPanel, states; `http` client, auth/permission providers, MSW mock layer, invalidation map | Storybook/gallery page shows all components; one existing screen migrated end-to-end |
| **1 Master data** | Auth & users/roles, Customers, Products (+categories), Merchants, Suppliers | CRUD with mock data, permissions gating nav |
| **2 Inventory & Procurement** | Warehouses, stock levels, movements, adjustments, transfers; PR/PO/GRN/invoice | Receiving increases stock in mock; low-stock → PR loop works |
| **3 Sales & POS** | Orders, payments (basic), fulfilment, returns; POS shell/session/sell/pay/receipt/held | Order → stock → payment flow; POS ≤4-tap sale |
| **4 Referrals, Commissions, Payouts** | Codes/network, engine (mock), approvals, payout requests/approval/batches, wallet | Order completion generates commissions; payout paid updates balances |
| **5 Production** | BOM, WO, stages, WIP board, costing | Shortage → PR; output → stock |
| **6 Finance** | Accounts, auto-posting (mock), ledger, AR/AP, expenses, periods, reconciliation | Trial balance nets to zero across all mock flows |
| **7 Reporting & Audit** | Report hub + catalogue, exports, scheduling UI, audit log | Every report drills to source; audit shows all mutations |
| **8 Polish** | Responsive QA, a11y audit, performance (lazy charts, virtualized tables), empty/error states sweep, live-API switch | Definition of Done (Doc 1 §18) for every screen |
Portals (customer/merchant) migrate alongside their module in each phase.

### 17.3 Integration to live APIs
Flip `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MODE=live` **per feature** (feature flags) once endpoints exist; contract tests compare mock fixtures vs. OpenAPI schema; keep envelope/error formats from Doc 1 §16.2. Backend to provide: `/auth/me` (with permissions), `/nav/counts`, event-driven effects listed in §1, SSE/WebSocket optional for notifications and POS transfer confirmation (polling fallback).

### 17.4 Mobile app alignment (Flutter, Dio)
Reuse this spec as the behavioural reference: same endpoints/models, same status maps/tones, same permission keys, same workflows. The web UI is a UX reference, not a copy — POS, portal (wallet, referrals, commissions, payouts) and merchant flows are the priority for mobile.

### 17.5 QA & acceptance
Each workflow in §3–§13 becomes an **end-to-end test script** (mock mode first): e.g., *"Place order with referrer upline → pay → fulfil → complete → commission pending → approve → payout → paid; verify: stock, payments, JE balance, commission statuses, balances, audit trail."* A release is accepted when all scripts pass, Doc 1 §18 DoD holds per screen, and trial balance/valuation reconciliations show zero difference in mock data.

## 18. Open Decisions Register (to close with the client)

| # | Decision | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Commission %, number of levels, qualification trigger, holding period, caps | Commissions, Referrals, Finance, Portal copy |
| 2 | Order "Completed" = on payment vs on delivery; revenue recognition timing | Orders, Finance, Commissions |
| 3 | Clawback policy for paid commissions | Commissions, Payouts |
| 4 | Payout method (bank API vs manual/batch), minimum, schedule, fees, KYC level | Payouts, Customers |
| 5 | User roles list and approval limits/thresholds | Users/Roles, all approvals |
