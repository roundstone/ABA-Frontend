# ABA Online ERP — Document 3: Operations & Finance

**Covers:** Procurement · Inventory · Production · Payments · Payouts · Commissions · Finance & Accounting
**Depends on:** Doc 1 (design system, DataTable, forms, states) and Doc 2 (Suppliers, Products, Orders, Customers, Merchants, POS).
**Conventions:** same as Doc 2 (permission keys `module.action`, reference numbers, soft delete, audit on every mutation, standard states, standard toast, merchant/warehouse scoping).

---

## Global rules for this document

1. **Documents vs. ledgers.** Business documents (PR, PO, GRN, Production Order, Payment, Payout) are editable only while `draft`. Ledgers (stock movements, wallet ledger, commission ledger, journal entries) are **append-only**: corrections are made by reversing/adjusting entries, never edits.
2. **Every state transition is an API action** (`POST /{resource}/:id/{action}`) with a reason where required, and appears on the record's Timeline (Doc 1 Timeline component).
3. **Approvals** use the `ApprovalPanel` component. Approval chains are configured in Settings per document type with amount thresholds (e.g., PO ≤ ₦500k → Procurement Manager; > ₦500k → Finance Manager + Admin). A user cannot approve their own request.
4. **Reference numbers:** `PR-0001`, `PO-2041`, `GRN-0310`, `SINV-…` (supplier invoice), `INV-…` (customer invoice), `WO-…` (production order), `BOM-…`, `TRF-…`, `ADJ-…`, `CNT-…` (stock count), `PAY-…`, `RFD-…`, `PYT-…` (payout), `COM-…`, `JE-…` (journal entry).
5. **Posting is automatic.** Operational modules never let users type journal entries; they emit events and Finance posts entries via the posting rules in §7.4. Manual journals exist only in Finance with `finance.approve`.
6. **Warehouse/location** is a first-class dimension: Central warehouse, Production floor (WIP), Merchant shop locations, Quarantine/Damaged.

## 1.5 Dashboard
KPIs: **Procurement Spend (period), Open POs (value), Awaiting Approval (count), Overdue Deliveries, Payables Due (7d), Avg Lead Time.**
Charts: Spend trend (line, month), Spend by supplier (top 10 bar), Spend by category (donut), PO status funnel (Draft→Approved→Ordered→Received→Invoiced→Paid counts), Supplier on-time delivery (bar).
Sections: **Pending approvals** (rows with Approve/Review), **Deliveries due this week** (PO, supplier, expected date, days late in red), **Low-stock suggestions** (products at/below reorder level with "Create request" bulk action), Recent POs.

## 1.6 Purchase Requests (PR)
**List:** search PR no./requester/product; filters Status, Requester, Department/Location, Date, Urgency, Linked PO (has/none); columns PR #, Requested by, Location, Items, Est. value, Urgency, Required by, Status, Age; bulk: Approve, Reject, Convert to PO (same supplier grouping), Export; row: View, Edit (draft), Submit, Approve, Reject, Convert to PO, Cancel.
**Form (full page):**
| Field | Type | Req | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request type | select: Raw materials / Finished goods / Other | Yes | |
| Deliver to | warehouse combobox | Yes | |
| Required by | date | Yes | ≥ today |
| Urgency | select Low/Normal/High/Critical | Yes | default Normal |
| Reason/justification | textarea | Yes if High/Critical | ≤500 |
| Lines (LineItemsEditor) | product*, qty*(>0), unit, est. unit cost (prefilled last price), preferred supplier, note | ≥1 line | Duplicate product warning |
| Attachments | FileUploader | No | |
Buttons: Save draft / **Submit for approval**. Sources: manual, "Create request" from low-stock alert or Production shortage (prefilled, flagged `auto`).
**Approval:** ApprovalPanel; Approve (optional comment) / Reject (comment required) / **Request changes** (returns to draft). On approval → `approved`, ready to convert.

## 1.7 Purchase Orders (PO)
**List:** filters Status, Supplier, Warehouse, Date, Expected delivery, Payment status, Amount; columns PO #, Supplier, Date, Expected, Items, Total, Received %, Invoiced %, Payment status, Status; bulk: Export, Send to supplier, Cancel; row: View, Edit (draft), Send/Issue, Receive, Create invoice, Duplicate, Cancel, Close.
**Form:** Supplier* (shows terms, balance, credit warning), Deliver to*, Order date*, Expected delivery*, Payment terms (default from supplier), Currency (+rate if not NGN), Reference/quote no., Lines (product*, supplier SKU, qty*, unit price*, tax, discount, line total; price variance vs. last purchase >10% shows amber chip), Shipping/other charges, Notes to supplier, Internal notes, Terms.
Totals: Subtotal, Discount, Tax, Shipping, **Total**. Create from approved PR(s) prefills lines and links back (PR status → `converted`).
**Actions:** Save draft · Submit for approval (if above threshold; else auto-approve) · **Issue PO** (status `ordered`; generates PDF, emails supplier optional) · Print/PDF · Cancel (reason; blocked if received qty > 0 → "Close short" instead) · Amend (creates revision v2; re-approval if total increases >5%).
**Detail:** header (PO no., supplier link, status, StepIndicator: Draft → Approved → Ordered → Partially Received → Received → Invoiced → Paid), cards (Total, Received value, Invoiced, Paid, Balance), tabs as §1.4. Receiving tab lists GRNs; Invoices tab lists supplier invoices; Payments tab payments applied; Timeline.

## 1.8 Receiving (Goods Receipt Note)
**Form (`/procurement/receiving/new?po=`):** PO* (open POs only, shows supplier), Receiving warehouse*, Received date*, Delivery note no., Vehicle/driver (opt.), Lines: ordered, previously received, **received now*** (≤ remaining + over-receipt tolerance %), **accepted qty**, **rejected qty** (reason select: Damaged, Wrong item, Quality fail, Short), batch/lot no., expiry (if tracked), bin/location, Notes, Attachments (photos, delivery note).
Behavior: **Partial receiving** is default-supported (remaining qty stays open, PO → `partially_received`); receiving beyond tolerance blocked with message; rejected qty goes to Quarantine location and creates optional Purchase Return.
**On Post GRN:** stock movement `receipt` (+ accepted qty at warehouse, at PO cost) → Inventory valuation updated (weighted avg) → Finance posts **Dr Inventory / Cr GRNI (Goods received not invoiced)** → PO received% updated → requester notified.
Statuses: Draft, Posted (success), Voided (error; reversal movement, only if no downstream issue).

## 1.9 Supplier Invoices
**Form:** Supplier*, Supplier invoice no.* (unique per supplier), Invoice date*, Due date (auto from terms), PO(s)/GRN(s) to match*, Lines pulled from GRNs (qty, price) editable within tolerance, Additional charges/tax, Attachment (PDF/photo).
**Three-way match panel:** PO vs GRN vs Invoice per line (qty, price); mismatches beyond tolerance (default 2% price / 0 qty) shown red, invoice status → `on_hold` until Procurement Manager resolves (Approve variance with reason, or request credit note).
**Post:** Dr GRNI (and variance account) / Cr Accounts Payable; invoice status `approved` → appears in Finance Payables; Pay via Payments (supplier payment).
Statuses: Draft, Matched (info), On hold (warning), Approved (success), Partially paid (warning), Paid (success), Overdue (error, computed), Void.

## 1.10 Purchase Returns (to supplier)
Select GRN/PO lines → qty, reason → ship-back → stock issue movement, debit note → reduces payable. Statuses Draft, Approved, Shipped, Credited.

## 1.11 Modals
Approve/Reject (comment), Issue PO (confirm + "Email supplier" checkbox + supplier email), Cancel PO (reason), Close short (reason: accept shortfall), Convert PRs (drawer: choose grouping by supplier, review lines), Resolve match variance (reason), Void GRN (typed "VOID").

## 1.12 Statuses summary
PR: Draft, Awaiting Approval, Approved, Rejected, Converted, Cancelled. PO: Draft, Awaiting Approval, Approved, Ordered, Partially Received, Received, Closed, Cancelled. GRN/Invoice as above.

## 1.13 Workflow
```text
Need (manual / low-stock / production shortage) → Purchase Request → Approval
→ Purchase Order → Approval (threshold) → Issue to Supplier
→ Goods Received (full/partial) → Inventory updated (+GRNI in Finance)
→ Supplier Invoice → 3-way match → Payable posted → Supplier Payment
→ Finance (AP cleared, cash out) → Supplier performance updated → Reports
```

## 1.14 Relationships
Suppliers, Products, Inventory (receipts, returns), Production (shortages), Finance (GRNI, AP, purchase expense), Payments (supplier payments), Approvals/Users, Reports, Audit.

## 1.15 Notifications
In-app + email: PR submitted → approver; approved/rejected → requester; PO issued → supplier (optional) & requester; delivery due tomorrow/overdue → Procurement; GRN posted → requester & Finance; invoice on hold → Procurement Manager; invoice due in 3 days/overdue → Finance. Toasts: "PO-2041 approved", errors with reason.

## 1.16 States
Empty PR list "No purchase requests yet — Create request"; PO detail 404; receiving with no open POs "No purchase orders awaiting receipt"; approver without limit sees Approve disabled with tooltip "Above your approval limit (₦x). Escalate to {role}". Action failure preserves form.

**Audited:** all submits/approvals/rejections, PO issue/amend/cancel, GRN post/void, invoice match overrides, tolerance settings.

## 2.5 Dashboard
KPIs: **Inventory Value, Total SKUs in stock, Low-stock items, Out-of-stock items, Stock in transit, Adjustments (period, value)**. Charts: Inventory movement (stacked in/out by source), Value by warehouse (bar), Value by category (donut), Stock ageing (bar buckets 0–30/31–60/61–90/90+ days), Top moving vs. slow moving. Sections: Low-stock table (product, on hand, reorder level, suggested qty, **Create request**), Pending transfers/adjustments awaiting approval, Expiring batches (if tracked).

## 2.6 Stock levels
- **Views:** By product (default; expandable rows to locations/variants) · By location.

- **Columns:** Product (image, name, SKU), Location, **On hand**, **Reserved** (orders/holds/production allocations), **Available** (= on hand − reserved), **In transit**, **On order** (open POs), Reorder level, Avg cost, Value, Status chip.
- **Row actions:** View product movements, Adjust, Transfer, Create purchase request. **Export:** CSV/Excel/PDF stock report. Clicking On hand opens **Movement drawer** (last 50 movements for that product/location).

## 2.7 Stock movements (ledger, read-only)
Columns: Date/time, Movement no., **Type**, Product, Location (from → to), Qty (+/−, colored), Unit cost, Value, Balance after, **Source document** (EntityLink: PO/GRN, Order, POS sale, WO, Transfer, Adjustment, Return), User. Filters: Type, Product, Location, Date, Source module, User. Types:

| Type | Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Receipt | GRN posted | + at receiving warehouse |
| Sales issue | Order fulfilled / POS sale completed | − at source location |
| Reservation | Order placed / production allocated | Reserved ↑ (no on-hand change) |
| Sales return | Return approved & restocked | + (or Quarantine if damaged) |
| Purchase return | Return shipped | − |
| Production consumption | WO materials issued/consumed | − raw at floor/warehouse |
| Production output | WO output posted | + finished goods |
| Transfer out / in | Transfer shipped / received | − source, + in-transit; − in-transit, + destination |
| Adjustment ± | Approved adjustment or count variance | ± with reason |
| Write-off | Damaged/expired | − to expense |
Each movement stores unit cost snapshot; **never edited or deleted**.

## 2.8 Transfers
**List:** filters Status, From, To, Date, Product; columns TRF #, From, To, Items, Qty, Requested by, Status, Date.
**Form:** From*, To* (≠ From; merchants only their own as destination/source), Required date, Lines (product*, qty* ≤ available at source, batch), Notes. Buttons Save draft / **Submit** (approval if configured, e.g., value > threshold or to merchant).
**Flow:** Draft → Awaiting Approval → Approved → **Shipped** (source movement out; qty → In transit; waybill/driver fields) → **Received** (destination confirms qty per line; **shortage/damage** recorded creates adjustment & discrepancy flag) → Completed. Partial receipt allowed (remaining stays in transit until resolved). Cancel allowed before shipping.
Merchant restock requests: a merchant manager creates a transfer request; central warehouse approves and ships.

## 2.9 Adjustments
**Form:** Location*, Reason* (Damage, Expiry, Theft/Loss, Count correction, Found stock, Opening balance, Other), Date, Lines (product*, system qty (read-only), **new qty** or **± qty**, unit cost (for increases; default avg), note), Attachments (photos), Notes. Value impact panel (total ± ₦). Above approval threshold → approval required; otherwise posts on submit. **On post:** movement(s) + Finance entry (Dr/Cr Inventory vs Inventory adjustment/Shrinkage expense).

## 2.10 Stock counts (reconciliation)
Stepper: **1 Create** (location, scope: full/by category/cycle count, freeze movements optional, date) → **2 Count** (sheet per product, blind count option hides system qty; enter counted qty; mobile-friendly with barcode scan; multiple counters assign) → **3 Review** (variance table: system, counted, variance qty, variance value; recount request flag; threshold highlights) → **4 Approve & post** (creates adjustment for variances; Finance entry) . Statuses: Draft, Counting, Under Review, Approved/Posted, Cancelled.

## 2.11 Valuation
Method: **Weighted average cost** (default; FIFO as setting only if agreed with Finance). Page: totals by location/category/product with Qty, Avg cost, Value; **as-of date** selector (recomputes from movements); export; reconciliation check "Inventory subledger vs Finance Inventory account" (difference shown, drill to movements).

```

## 3.5 Dashboard
KPIs: **Orders in Progress, Units Produced (period), Planned vs Actual (%), Yield %, Scrap %, Production Cost (period), Overdue Orders**. Charts: Output planned vs actual (column+line), Yield/scrap trend, Cost per unit trend, Orders by stage (bar). Sections: **Material shortages** (WOs blocked by low raw stock with "Create purchase request"), Today's schedule, Recent completions.

## 3.6 Bills of Materials
**List:** columns BOM #, Finished product, Version, Yield qty, Components (count), Std cost, Status; filters Status, Product.
**Form (full page):** Finished product* (type Finished good), Version (auto), Output qty* & unit (e.g., 1 pair), **Components table** (Material*, Qty per output*, Unit, Wastage % (default 0), Substitute (opt.), Cost/unit (read-only avg), Line cost), **Operations/Stages** (Stage name, Sequence, Work centre/team, Std time min, Labour cost/unit), Overhead % or ₦/unit, Notes. Live **Standard cost** = Σ materials (incl. wastage) + labour + overhead; compares to selling price (margin).
Rules: one **active** BOM per product (new version → old becomes Archived on activation, in-flight WOs keep their version); circular references blocked; draft → **Activate** (`production.approve`).
Statuses: Draft, Active (success), Archived (neutral).

## 3.7 Production Orders (WO)
**List:** filters Status, Product, Stage, Date, Priority, Assigned team; columns WO #, Product, Planned qty, Produced, Rejected, Progress bar, Current stage, Start/Due dates, Status, Cost.
**Form:** Product* (auto-picks active BOM; select version), Planned qty*, Priority, Planned start*, Due*, Output location*, Source location for materials*, Assigned to/team, Linked sales order/merchant demand (opt.), Notes.
**Material requirement panel (auto):** per component: required (qty × planned × (1+wastage)), available (source location), reserved, **shortage** (red) with **Create purchase request** button. Release blocked if shortage unless "Allow partial release" (`production.approve`).
**Lifecycle actions:** Save draft → **Release** (status `released`; materials **reserved**) → **Start** → stage progress → **Complete** → Close.
**Detail:** header (WO no., product, status, progress), StepIndicator of BOM stages; cards: Planned/Produced/Rejected, Materials cost, Labour, Overhead, **Total cost & cost/unit**, Variance vs standard.
Tabs: **Overview · Materials · Stages · Output · Costs · Timeline**.
- **Materials:** table required vs issued vs consumed vs returned; **Issue materials** (drawer: qty per line, batch; movement Production consumption issue from warehouse → WIP), **Return unused** (back to stock), **Record scrap/wastage** (qty, reason).
- **Stages:** per stage: status (Pending/In progress/Done), start/end, assigned operator, qty passed/rejected, notes; **Start stage / Complete stage** (drawer: qty in, qty good, qty rejected, reject reason, time spent); next stage unlocks in sequence (configurable skipping).
- **Output:** **Record output** (drawer: qty good*, qty rejected, batch/lot, location, date; partial outputs allowed) → finished goods movement + Finance WIP→FG.
- **Costs:** actual vs standard by material/labour/overhead.

## 3.8 WIP board `/production/wip`
Kanban columns = stages (Cutting, Stitching, Assembly, Finishing, QC, Packing — configurable); cards = WO (product, qty, due date, days in stage, priority colour); drag-to-advance disabled unless user has `production.process` and stage completion form passes (drag opens the stage-complete drawer). Filters: product, team, priority. Mobile: stage tabs with card list.

## 3.9 Materials view
Aggregated requirements across released/planned WOs vs stock and open POs → **Net shortage** (required − available − on order); action "Create purchase requests" grouped by supplier.

## 3.10 Costing
Actual cost formula: **Materials consumed at avg cost + labour (stage time × rate or per-unit) + allocated overhead** ÷ good output units = unit cost, which becomes the finished goods' cost in inventory. Variance analysis (price, usage, yield). Rejected units' cost is absorbed by good units (setting) or expensed as scrap.

## 3.11 Modals
Release WO (confirm; shows reservations), Issue materials, Return materials, Start/Complete stage, Record output, Record scrap, Cancel WO (reason; releases reservations; consumed materials become WIP loss → requires approval), Close WO (variance summary; posts remaining WIP variance).

## 3.12 Statuses
WO: Draft, Planned, Released (info), In Progress (info), Paused (warning; reason), Completed (success), Closed (neutral), Cancelled (error). Stage: Pending, In Progress, Done, Skipped. Material line: Reserved, Partially issued, Issued, Consumed.

## 3.13 Workflow
```text
Production Request/Demand → BOM (active) → Production Order → Material availability check
→ (shortage → Purchase Request → PO → GRN) → Release (reserve raw)
→ Issue/Consume materials (raw − , WIP +) → Stages (cut → stitch → assemble → QC → pack)
→ Record output (finished goods +) → Costing (unit cost) → Close
→ Inventory (finished stock) → Sales/POS → Finance (WIP, COGS) → Reports
```

## 3.14 Relationships
Products (BOM, types), Inventory (reservation, consumption, output), Procurement (shortages), Finance (WIP, FG, variances), Sales (demand), Users/teams, Reports, Audit.

## 3.15 Notifications & states
Shortage detected, WO released/started/completed, WO overdue, stage rejected qty above threshold (Production Manager), output posted (Inventory). Empty: "No production orders — Create one from an active BOM"; no active BOM → Alert with "Create BOM". Failures keep entered quantities. **Audited:** BOM activation/versioning, WO release/cancel/close, consumption, output, scrap, cost overrides.

# 5. PAYOUTS

## 5.1 Purpose
Move money **out** to referrers/customers (commission withdrawals), merchants (settlements), and staff/others (optional), through a controlled request → approval → processing flow. (Supplier payments use Payments §4, and appear in payout batches only if the client wants unified bank runs.)

## 5.2 Users
Referrers/Customers (request from portal), Merchant Owners (settlement request), Finance Officer (process), Finance Manager/Admin (approve).

## 5.3 Permissions
`payouts.view, create` (create request on behalf), `approve`, `process` (initiate transfers/mark paid), `cancel`, `export`, `settings` (min amounts, schedule, fees, limits, methods). Approval limit per role.

## 5.4 Navigation

```

## 5.5 Dashboard
KPIs: **Pending Requests (count/₦), Approved awaiting processing, Paid (period), Failed, Avg processing time, Wallet liability (total owed to referrers)**. Charts: Payouts over time (bars), By type (referrer/merchant/other), By status. Table: oldest pending (ageing coloring >48h amber, >5d red).

## 5.6 Requests list
Search: payout no., payee, account no. Filters: Type (Commission withdrawal, Wallet withdrawal, Merchant settlement, Other), Status, Method, Date, Amount, Payee, Batch. Columns: Payout #, Requested, Payee (avatar + type), Source (Commissions/Wallet/Settlement), Amount, Fee, Net, Destination (bank ••••1234), Status, Approved by, Actions. Bulk: **Approve selected**, **Add to batch**, Export bank file (CSV/NIBSS-format per bank template), Reject. Row: View, Approve, Reject, Process, Mark paid manually, Retry, Cancel.

## 5.7 Create payout request (portal for payee; also staff form)
| Field | Type | Req | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source | select: Commission balance / Wallet balance | Yes | Shows available |
| Amount | currency | Yes | ≥ minimum (setting), ≤ available, ≤ daily/monthly limit; "Withdraw all" shortcut |
| Destination | saved bank accounts select or "Add account" (Bank*, Account no.* 10 digits, Account name auto-resolved & shown; must match payee name (setting) ) | Yes | New account requires OTP verification |
| Note | text | No | |
Summary: Fee, **Net to receive**, expected timeline. Submit → status `pending`; funds moved to **hold** (available ↓) so the balance can't be double-spent.

## 5.8 Detail & approval
Header: `PYT-…`, status, amount; actions by state. Cards: Payee summary (KYC status, lifetime payouts, current balance), Source breakdown (which commission records/wallet ledger lines are included — links), Destination (masked; **first-time/changed account flagged red "New destination"**), Risk checks (auto): payee KYC verified, account name match, duplicate request within 24h, amount above payee's average ×3, pending disputes. **ApprovalPanel**: Approve/Reject (reason required for reject; approve above limit requires higher role). Timeline.

## 5.9 Processing
**Approve** → `approved`. **Process** (individually or batch): method options: **Automated bank transfer** (via backend integration: status → `processing`; webhook → `paid`/`failed`) or **Manual** (Finance pays externally and enters: transfer ref*, date*, proof) → `paid`. On `paid`: release hold → deduct source balance, record outgoing Payment (`PAY-…`), Finance posts Dr Commission payable / Wallet liability, Cr Bank (+ fee), payee notified with receipt. On `failed`: funds returned to available, reason shown, retry allowed (max 3) or reject.
**Batches:** create batch from approved requests (select/filters; total, count), review, **Submit batch** (single approval for total), export bank file, upload results file to mark paid/failed en masse (row-level results table). Statuses: Draft, Approved, Processing, Completed, Partially Failed.

## 5.10 Statuses
Pending (info), Approved (info), Processing (info), Paid (success), Failed (error), Rejected (error), Cancelled (neutral), On Hold (warning; compliance).

## 5.11 Settings
Minimum/maximum payout, daily limit, schedule (On request / Weekly Friday / Monthly), fee rule (flat/%/free), auto-approve below ₦x for verified payees (off by default), required KYC level, method availability, holding period after commission approval.

## 5.12 Workflow
```text
Commission approved → Available balance → Payout request (hold) → Risk checks

Failure → funds released → retry/reject
```

## 5.13 Relationships
Commissions, Customers (wallet, bank accounts), Merchants (settlement), Payments (outgoing), Finance, Notifications, Audit.

## 5.14 Notifications & states
Payee (SMS/email/push): request received, approved, paid (with reference), failed, rejected (reason). Finance: new request, awaiting > 48h, batch result, high-risk flag. Empty portal state: "No payouts yet — earn commissions to withdraw". Below-minimum: field error "Minimum withdrawal is ₦x". **Audited:** create/approve/reject/process/manual pay/retry, bank account add/change, settings changes.

# 6. COMMISSIONS

## 6.1 Purpose
Calculate, approve, track, and reverse referral commissions across the upline/downline structure using **configurable rules** (the client's percentages, number of levels, earning rules and payout method are still to be confirmed — nothing below hard-codes them).

## 6.2 Users
Referrers/customers (view own), Sales Manager (rules & performance), Finance (approval), Admin, Merchants (if merchant commissions apply).

## 6.3 Permissions
`commissions.view` (own by default), `view_all`, `create` (manual adjustment), `approve`, `process` (mark payable), `cancel`/reverse, `export`, `settings` (plans & rules).

## 6.4 Navigation

## 6.5 Dashboard
KPIs: **Commission Generated (period), Pending Approval, Approved (unpaid), Paid, Reversed, Avg per Referrer, Outstanding Liability**. Charts: Commission trend (stacked Pending/Approved/Paid), By level (bar L1…Ln), Top earners (bar), Commission as % of sales (line). Alerts: records pending approval > 3 days, reversals pending, rules expiring.

## 6.6 Rules & plans (configurable engine)
**Plan (list/form):** Name*, Description, Status, Effective from*/to, Applies to (All products / categories / specific products), Applies to merchants (all/selected), Customer group (all/selected).
**Plan settings:**
| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| Qualification trigger | Order paid / Order delivered-completed / First order only / Every order / Minimum cumulative spend ₦x |
| Minimum qualifying order value | ₦x |
| Levels | Number of upline levels paid (1…N, N configurable) |
| Rate table | Per level: type (% of net sales / % of margin / fixed ₦ per unit / fixed ₦ per order), value, cap per order, cap per period |
| Base amount | Net of discounts & tax? (yes/no), include delivery fee? (no), exclude refunded portion |
| Approval mode | Auto-approve / Manual approval / Auto below ₦x |
| Holding period | Days after trigger before approval (covers return window) |
| Payout eligibility | Minimum balance, payout method restrictions |
| Overrides | Product-level rule (Products form §G), Merchant-level override, Campaign boosts (start/end, multiplier) |
| Self-referral/fraud rules | Block same phone/device/bank account across chain; max referrals per day |
Rule conflicts resolved by priority: Product override > Campaign > Merchant override > Plan default; the **Simulator** shows the resolved rule.
**Simulator:** pick customer (shows upline chain), products/qty/price → outputs table: Level, Beneficiary, Rate applied, Amount, Rule source, Status (would qualify?) — no records created.
Rule changes apply to **future** orders only; plan versions are immutable snapshots referenced by each commission record.

## 6.7 Commission records
**List:** search COM #, beneficiary, order no., referred customer. Filters: Status, Level, Beneficiary, Source customer, Order, Plan, Merchant, Date, Amount, Payout (paid/unpaid). Columns: Commission #, Date, Beneficiary (avatar/name), **Source** (order link + buyer), Level, Base amount, Rate, **Commission**, Plan/version, Status, Payout ref, Actions. Bulk: Approve, Reject, Export. Row: View, Approve, Reject, Reverse, Adjust (manual), View order.
**Detail:** Header (COM #, status, amount). Sections: **Calculation breakdown** (order lines → eligible base → rate → level → cap applied → result — every step displayed so support can explain it), **Referral chain visual** (buyer → L1 → L2 …, highlighting beneficiary), Related order/payment status, Approval panel, Payout link, **Timeline**, ledger entries.

## 6.8 Calculation & lifecycle
```text
Order event meets plan trigger → Engine resolves rule (priority) → For each upline level up to N:
  compute amount (base × rate, caps) → create record `pending` (with holding period)
→ Holding period ends & order not returned → auto/manual Approval → `approved` (adds to beneficiary Available balance)
→ Payout request → Paid (`paid` when payout completes)
```
Idempotent: one record per (order, level, beneficiary, plan version). Partial payments: commission accrues proportionally or at full payment (plan setting).

## 6.9 Reversal
Triggers: order cancelled, refunded/returned (full or partial → **proportional reversal**), fraud finding, manual. Behavior by status: Pending → cancelled; Approved (unpaid) → reversed (balance decreases); **Paid → creates negative balance / clawback** (deducted from future commissions; flagged for Finance). Reversal record links to original; requires reason; large or paid reversals need approval. Statuses: Reversal Pending → Reversed.

## 6.10 Approvals queue
Table of pending records grouped by order/beneficiary, filters by age, amount; row expand to breakdown; bulk approve (confirm dialog shows count & total); reject requires reason; fraud flags visible (self-referral suspicion, unusual velocity) — flagged records can't be bulk-approved.

## 6.11 Manual adjustment (modal)
Beneficiary*, Type (Bonus / Correction / Clawback)*, Amount*, Reason* (≥10), Attachment; requires `commissions.create` + approval; appears in ledger as `adjustment`.

## 6.12 Beneficiary (portal) view — `/account/commissions`
Balance cards: Pending, Available, Paid, Lifetime. Tabs: Earnings (records), **My network** (levels list/tree with counts and status), Payouts. Referral link/code with copy & share (WhatsApp), QR. Explains each record in plain language ("Level 1 — 5% of ₦40,000 order by Ada O.").

## 6.13 Statuses
Pending (info), Approved (success), Paid (success), Rejected (error), Reversed (error), On Hold (warning: fraud/dispute), Cancelled (neutral).

## 6.14 Relationships
Orders/POS/Payments (triggers), Referrals (chain), Customers (beneficiary balance), Payouts, Finance (commission expense & payable), Products/Merchants (overrides), Reports, Audit.

## 6.15 Notifications & states
Beneficiary: commission earned (pending), approved, paid, reversed (reason). Finance/Sales: approvals waiting, fraud flag, rule expiring. Empty: "No commissions yet — share your referral link" (portal), "No records for filters". Engine failure on an order → `commission_error` flag on order + admin alert with Retry. **Audited:** rule/plan edits (before/after), approvals, rejections, reversals, manual adjustments, engine retries.

| Supplier payment | Dr Accounts Payable / Cr Bank/Cash |
| Production: materials issued | Dr WIP / Cr Raw materials inventory |
| Production: labour/overhead applied | Dr WIP / Cr Labour applied / Overhead applied |

| Inventory adjustment/write-off | Dr/Cr Inventory shrinkage expense vs Inventory |
| Manual expense | Dr Expense account / Cr Bank/Cash/AP |
Each posting stores `source_module`, `source_id`, `event`, is **idempotent**, dated by the source document date, and is blocked if the period is closed (queued to next open period with a flag). Posting failures appear in **Finance → Overview → "Unposted events"** with Retry.

## 7.6 Overview dashboard
