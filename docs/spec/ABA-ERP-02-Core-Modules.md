# ABA Online ERP — Document 2: Core ERP Modules

**Covers:** Authentication & User Management · Customers · Products · Merchants · Suppliers · Sales & Orders · Merchant POS
**Depends on:** Doc 1 (tokens, shell, components, DataTable, forms, states). Anything not restated here follows Doc 1.
**Conventions used below:** Permission keys `module.action`. Money in ₦ (minor units in API). "Standard states" = Doc 1 §12 (loading skeleton, empty, filtered-empty, error+retry, 403, 404). "Standard toast" = `{Record} {action}.` Statuses map to Doc 1 §2.5 tones. Where a module needs a screen not listed, reuse the page templates in Doc 1 §6.4.

---

## Global rules that apply to all modules in this document

1. **Reference numbers** (system-generated, immutable, mono font, copyable): Customer `CUS-000123`, Product SKU (user-defined) , Merchant `MER-0042`, Supplier `SUP-0017`, Order `ORD-10482`, Payment `PAY-…`, Refund `RFD-…`, Return `RTN-…`. Prefix/padding configurable in Settings.
2. **Soft delete only.** "Delete" is allowed only for records with no dependencies (no orders, movements, payments); otherwise the action is "Deactivate/Archive". The delete confirm dialog explains which of the two applies.
3. **Every mutation writes an audit entry** (Doc 4 §Audit). Each module section lists the audited events.
4. **Merchant scoping:** users with a merchant scope only ever see records where `merchantId ∈ scope`; the merchant selector (Doc 1 §6.2) is hidden for them.
5. **Duplicate prevention:** phone/email/SKU/code uniqueness checked async on blur, with a link to the existing record when a duplicate is found.

# 1. AUTHENTICATION & USER MANAGEMENT

## 1.1 Purpose
Identity, sessions, roles, and permissions for every ERP user (staff, merchant users, referrers/customers with portal access, auditors).

## 1.2 Users
Super Admin / Admin (manage users & roles); every user (login, profile, security); Auditor (view-only).

## 1.3 Permissions
`users.view, users.create, users.edit, users.delete, users.approve` (activate/suspend), `users.settings` (security policies), `roles.view/create/edit/delete`, `audit.view`. Self-service actions (profile, password, sessions) need no permission.

## 1.4 Navigation
```text
/login  /forgot-password  /reset-password?token=  /verify-2fa  /accept-invite?token=
/account/profile   /account/security   /account/sessions   /account/notifications
/admin/users       /admin/users/new    /admin/users/[id]  (tabs: Overview · Roles & Access · Sessions · Activity)
/admin/roles       /admin/roles/new    /admin/roles/[id]
/admin/settings/security
```

## 1.5 Auth screens (auth layout: centered 420px card on `bg`, logo above, no sidebar)

### Login `/login`
| Field | Type | Req | Validation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Email or phone | text | Yes | Valid email or Nigerian phone | `autocomplete=username`; autofocus |
| Password | password (show toggle) | Yes | ≥1 char (don't reveal rules at login) | `autocomplete=current-password` |
| Remember this device | checkbox | No | | Extends session to 30 days |

Links: "Forgot password?". Submit **Sign in**. Behavior: on success → `next` param or role home (staff → `/dashboard`, merchant → `/merchant/dashboard`, customer → `/account/dashboard`). If 2FA enabled → `/verify-2fa` (6-digit OTP input, auto-submit on 6th digit, "Resend code" with 30s cooldown, "Use a recovery code"). Errors: wrong credentials → generic Alert "Email/phone or password is incorrect" (never say which); locked (5 failed attempts) → "Account locked. Try again in 15 minutes or reset your password"; suspended → "Your account is suspended. Contact your administrator"; unverified/invited → resend invite link. Rate-limit 429 → cooldown message.

### Forgot / Reset password
Forgot: single email field → always show success state "If an account exists, we've sent a reset link" (no enumeration). Reset: New password + Confirm; strength meter; rules ≥10 chars, upper, lower, number, not equal to last 5 passwords; expired/used token → error state with "Request new link". Success → toast + redirect to login; all other sessions revoked.

### Logout
User menu → **Sign out** (no confirm). If POS session is open → blocking dialog "You have an open POS session. Close it first" with link. Clears query cache and auth state; redirect `/login`.

### Accept invite `/accept-invite`
Shows name/role (read-only), set password, accept terms. Token expiry 72h.

## 1.3 Profile & security (self-service)
- **Profile:** avatar (ImageUploader), name, phone, email (change requires re-verification), language (English), timezone (default Africa/Lagos), notification preferences link.
- **Security:** change password (current + new + confirm); **Two-factor authentication** (enable via authenticator app QR + verify code; show 8 recovery codes once with Download/Copy; disable requires password); Login history (last 20: time, device, IP, location, result).
- **Sessions:** table of active sessions (device, browser, IP, last active, "This device" badge) with **Revoke** and **Sign out all other devices** (confirm).

## 1.4 User management

### Users list `/admin/users`
- **Title/description:** Users — "Manage who can access ABA Online and what they can do." **Primary action:** Invite user (`users.create`).
- **Search:** name, email, phone. **Filters:** Role (multi), Status, Merchant (combobox), Last active (range), 2FA (on/off). **Sort:** name, created, last active. **Pagination:** 25 default.
- **Bulk actions:** Deactivate, Activate, Assign role, Resend invite, Export.
- **Columns:** User (avatar+name+email), Role(s) (badge, +N), Merchant/Scope, Status, 2FA (icon), Last active, Created, Actions.
- **Row actions:** View, Edit, Change role, Reset password (sends link), Suspend/Activate, Revoke sessions, Delete (only if never logged in/no activity).
- **Export:** CSV/Excel.

### Invite / create user (drawer 640px)
| Field | Type | Req | Validation / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full name | text | Yes | 2–80 chars |
| Email | email | Yes | Unique |
| Phone | phone | No | Unique if provided |
| Role(s) | multi-combobox | Yes | ≥1 |
| User type | select: Staff / Merchant user / Auditor | Yes | Drives visible fields |
| Merchant | combobox | Yes if type = Merchant user | Scope |
| Warehouse access | multi-select | No | For inventory roles |
| Send invite email | switch | — | Default on; off → shows temporary password once |
Submit **Send invite** → user status `invited`, toast, appears in list.

### User detail `/admin/users/[id]`
Header: avatar, name, status badge, role chips; actions: Edit, Suspend/Activate, Reset password, More. Tabs: **Overview** (contact, type, merchant, created by, last login, 2FA), **Roles & Access** (roles, effective permissions read-only list grouped by module, warehouse/merchant scope), **Sessions** (active sessions + revoke), **Activity** (audit entries by/for this user, with link to full audit log filtered).

### Roles & permissions `/admin/roles`
- **List:** Role name, Description, Users count, Type (System/Custom), Updated. System roles cannot be deleted; can be cloned.
- **Role editor (full page):** Name (req, unique), Description, then **permission matrix**: rows = modules (grouped by sidebar group), columns = actions (View, Create, Edit, Delete, Approve, Export, Process, Cancel, Refund, Settings); cells are checkboxes; not-applicable cells disabled (rendered "—"); row toggle "All"; column toggle; dependency rule: any action requires View (auto-checks View); Approve thresholds (optional numeric "Approval limit ₦" for PO, payout, refund, commission). Sticky footer Save; dirty guard. Changing a role that has users → confirm "This affects {n} users. Continue?" and is audited with before/after diff.
- **Role assignment:** via user edit or bulk action; a user may hold multiple roles (permissions are the union).

## 1.5 Statuses
| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Invited (info) | Invite sent, not accepted |
| Active (success) | Can sign in |
| Suspended (error) | Blocked by admin; sessions revoked |
| Locked (warning) | Auto-locked after failed attempts; auto-expires |
| Deactivated (neutral) | Former user; retained for audit |

## 1.6 Workflow
Admin invites → email → user sets password (+optional 2FA) → active → admin can assign roles → suspension revokes sessions immediately → deactivation preserves history.

## 1.7 Relationships
All modules (permission gating), Audit (all events), Merchants (scope), Notifications (preferences).

## 1.8 Notifications
Email: invite, password reset, password changed, new-device login, 2FA enabled/disabled, account suspended. Admin in-app: user accepted invite, repeated failed logins. Toasts: "Invite sent to {email}", "User suspended", errors with reason.

## 1.9 States
Empty users list (only possible if filters) → filtered-empty; 403 on `/admin/*` → NoPermission; expired reset token → dedicated error card; deleted user → 404 with back link; failure of role save → Alert "Couldn't save role. No changes were applied."

**Audited events:** login success/fail, logout, password change/reset, 2FA change, user create/edit/suspend/activate/delete, role create/edit/delete, permission change, session revoke.

# 7. MERCHANT POS

Separate route group `(pos)` (Doc 1 §14.5). Optimised for speed: **common sale ≤ 4 taps** (tap items → Pay → tap exact/method → Done). Works on tablet landscape, phone, desktop.

## 7.1 Purpose
Fast in-store selling with cash/transfer/card/wallet payments, receipts, held orders, returns, and daily cash reconciliation, feeding Orders, Inventory, Payments, Finance, and Commissions in real time.

## 7.2 Users
Cashier, Merchant Manager/Owner (approvals, session reports), Platform Admin (oversight).

## 7.3 Permissions
`pos.access, pos.sell, pos.discount` (up to merchant limit), `pos.discount_override` (manager PIN), `pos.hold`, `pos.return`, `pos.refund` (manager PIN), `pos.cash_movement` (pay-in/out), `pos.session_open/close`, `pos.reports`, `pos.settings`.

## 7.4 Navigation (routes)

## 7.5 Session management
**Open session (full-screen card):** Register (select), Cashier (auto), **Opening cash balance*** (numeric keypad; default = previous closing float), Notes. **Open register** → creates session (`open`). Cannot sell without an open session; stale session (>24h) shows warning banner and requires manager to close.
**Cash movements (modal):** Pay in / Pay out, Amount*, Reason* (select: Float top-up, Bank drop, Expense, Other + note), audited; appears in session report.
**Close session (stepper):**
1. **Count cash:** denomination counter (₦1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5) or single total field → **Counted cash**.
2. **Review:** Expected cash = opening + cash sales − cash refunds + pay-ins − pay-outs; **Difference** (over/short) highlighted (green 0, amber small, red > tolerance); non-cash totals (transfer, card, wallet) with system-confirmed vs unconfirmed transfers.
3. **Confirm:** notes (required if difference ≠ 0); manager PIN if difference exceeds tolerance. → status `closed`, session report (printable), cash handover entry to Finance.
Held orders must be resolved (resume/void) before closing.

- **Search/scan bar** (always focused; matches name, SKU, barcode; Enter adds; scanner input adds instantly; no-match → "Product not found").
- **Category chips** (All, Favorites, categories; horizontal scroll) and **product grid**: tile = image, name, price, stock chip (green ok / amber low / red out — out-of-stock tiles disabled unless backorder). Tap adds 1; variant products open a **variant picker** (bottom sheet with size/color chips) then add. Long-press = quantity keypad.
**Right (cart):**
- Customer row: **Walk-in** default; tap to select/create (search by phone/name/code; inline "New customer" needs name+phone only); shows wallet balance & referrer; optional **referral code** field for first-time customers.
- Lines: name, variant, unit price, qty stepper (−/+; tap number for keypad), line total, swipe/trash to remove; tap line → line discount/edit price (within limit) & note.

- **Card:** amount sent to terminal (integration placeholder: "Awaiting card terminal…" with cancel); success returns auth code/last 4; failure → retry/other method.
- **Wallet:** requires customer selected; shows balance; if insufficient → offer **Split** for the remainder.
- **Split/hybrid:** add multiple tenders; each row (method, amount); remaining balance updates live; complete only when remaining = 0 (or partial payment allowed if setting on and customer selected → creates credit balance).
- **Complete:** button **Complete sale** → order created (`completed`, channel POS), payments recorded, stock issued at merchant location, finance entries, referral qualification/commission triggered. Success screen: big check, order no., change due, buttons **Print receipt · Send SMS/Email · New sale** (New sale is autofocus; auto-returns after 8s if enabled).
- Failure: order NOT created; cart preserved; error Alert with retry. Idempotency key prevents double charges on retry.

Exchange = return + new sale (guided "Exchange" button preloads credit as payment tender "Return credit").

## 7.11 Offline behavior
Indicator states: Online (green), Offline (amber "Offline — sales will sync"), Syncing. Offline permitted: cash sales, holds; product/price cache from last sync (with "last synced" timestamp). Blocked offline: card, transfer confirmation, wallet, returns of other-device sales.

States: no products (empty grid → "No products enabled for this shop"), search no results, offline banner, permission denied → PIN prompt ("Manager approval required") instead of dead-end. **Audited:** session open/close, cash movements, discounts/overrides, voids, holds deleted, returns/refunds, reprints, offline sync conflicts.
